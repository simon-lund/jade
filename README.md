# Jade

This is the home of Jade, a protoypical measurement tool implemented in Python.
Jade uses the dependency graph of a project generated by jdeps (tool of the JDK) to calculate the following measures.

- Number of Classes (NOC)
- Afferent Coupling (Ca)
- Efferent Coupling (Ce)
- Instability (I)
- Dependency Cohesion Measure based on LCOM3 (DCM<sub>LCOM3</sub>)
- Dependency Cohesion Measure based on similarity measures (DCM<sub>SIM</sub>)
- Dependency Cohesion Measure based on cohesion count (DCM<sub>CC</sub>)
- Package DepDegree based on DepDegree (P-DepDegree)
- Dependency Locality Measures (DLM)

To run Jade, install the dependencies in *requirements.txt* and setup the target configuration in config.py (cf. example in config.py).
Then run main.py. That's it :)
